\begin{problem}{Question 6}

Let $Y = l^1(\mathbb{N})$, and define $X = \{ f \in Y : \sum n |f(n)| < \infty \}$, equipped with the $l^1$ norm.

6.1

Prove that $X$ is a proper dense subspace of $Y$, and hence $X$ is not complete. 

6.2

Define $T: X \to Y$ that sends $f(n) \mapsto nf(n)$. Show that $T$ is a closed map, but not bounded.

6.3

Let $S = T^{-1}$. Prove that $S: Y \to X$ is bounded, surjective, but not open.

\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Solution]

6.1)

Without too much trouble, we can see $X$ is a vector subspace of $Y$. Of course, the sequence of all 0s satisfies this condition. Further, if $f, g \in X$, then, looking at partial sums, we have that:

$$ \sum_{i=1}^k i|f + g(i) | = \sum_{i=1}^k i | f(i) + g(i) | \leq \sum_{i=1}^k i | f(i)| + i|g(i)| = \sum_{i=1}^k i |f(i)| + \sum_{j=1}^\infty j | g(j) |$$  

Since the right side converges as $ k \to \infty$, due to $f, g \in X$, and all quantities being positive, so too must $\sum i |f + g(i)| < \infty$.

Similarly, we can see scalar multiplication as:

$$ \sum_{i=1}^k i |af(i)| = \sum_{i=1}^k i |a| |f(i)| = |a| \sum_{i=1}^k i |f(i)|$$

and again, since the right side converges, so too must the left.

Furthermore, this inclusion is proper. Consider the sequence $\{ 1/n^2 \} \in Y$. Clearly, via the integral test, the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 < \infty$. However, on the other hand, $\sum_{n=1}^\infty n 1/n^2 = \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n$ diverges, and hence this sequence is not in $X$.

Lastly, we want to show this subspace is dense. Let $g(n)$ be a sequence in $Y \setminus X$. Because we have that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty |g(n)| < \infty$, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $M$ such that for all $m > M$, $\sum_{n=m}^\infty |g(n)| < \epsilon$. Thus, construct the sequence $f$ such that $f(n) = g(n)$ for all $n \leq M$, and $0$ for all $n > M$. Clearly, $f$ resides in $X$, as only finitely many terms are non-0, hence $\sum_{n=1}^\infty n |f(n)|$ is a finite sum, and therefore finite.

Without too much trouble, by definition, we have that:

$$ \Vert f - g \Vert_1 = \sum_{n=1}^\infty |f(n) - g(n)| = \sum_{n=M+1} | -g(n)| < \epsilon $$

Thus, since $\epsilon$ can be as small as we want, for every open ball around our $g \in Y \setminus X$, we may find an $f$ in such an open ball. Hence, $X$ is dense.

However, $X$ cannot be complete then. As above, take a sequence of $f_n \to g$, where $\Vert f_n - g \Vert_1 < 1/n$. Evidently, this is a Cauchy sequence from the argument above, and it converges to an element in $Y \setminus X$.

6.2)

It should be clear that $T$ must be a closed map. If $f_k \to f$, and $T f_k$ is convergent, we show that $Tf_k \to Tf$. Indeed, we see that:

$$ \Vert Tf - Tf_k \Vert_1 = \sum_{n=1}^\infty | Tf(n) - Tf_k(n) | = \sum_{n=1}^\infty |n f(n) - n f_k(n)| = \sum_{n=1}^\infty |n| |f(n)  - f_k(n) | $$

Now, since $f_k \to f$, we have that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty | f(n) - f_k(n) | \to 0$. In particular, that means we can choose $k$ such that for each n, $| f(n) - f_k(n) | < \frac{1}{n} \frac{\epsilon}{2^n}$. Under this choice, the above inequality becomes:

$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty |n| |f(n)  - f_k(n) | \leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty |n| \frac{1}{n} \frac{\epsilon}{2^n} = \epsilon$$

Thus, we have that $Tf_k \to Tf$, and thus $T$ is closed.

However, it is clear that $T$ is not bounded. Let $f_i$ be the family of sequences with $0$ everywhere, except for at the $i$-th position. Evidently, $\Vert f_i \Vert_1 = 1$. However, $\Vert Tf_i \Vert_1 = i$, and since in this family, we can choose $i$ arbitrarily large, $T$ cannot be bounded.

6.3)

Clearly, $S$ is surjective, since as we saw, $T$ is a map that takes $f \in X$ to $Tf$, and evidently, $S \circ T(f) = f \in X$. Hence, we can always find a sequence in $Y$ that maps to any sequence in $X$.

Moreover, $S$ must be bounded. If we look at the action of $S$, $S$ sends $f(n) \in Y$ to $\frac{1}{n} f(n) \in X$. Evidently then, we have that:

$$ \Vert Sf \Vert_1 = \sum_{k=1}^\infty | 1/k f(k) | \leq \sum_{k=1}^\infty | f(k)| = \Vert f \Vert_1$$

and so $S$ is bounded, at least by $1$.

However, $S$ is certainly not open. By Folland, we may say that $S$ is open if and only if, for $B$ the open ball of radius 1 around 0 in $Y$, $S(B)$ contains a ball centered around $0$ in $X$.

Fix an $i \in \mathbb{N}$. We can then consider the family of sequences $g_i$ such that $g(i) = 2/i$, and 0 otherwise. Evidently, we may find a sequence as close to 0 as we want, since $\Vert g_i \Vert_1 = 2/i$. However, for no $i$ does there exists a $y \in B$ such that $Sy = g_i$, since under the map $T$, we see that $Tg_i(n)$ is $2$ when $n=i$ and $0$ otherwise, outside of $B$. Hence, $S$ is not open.

\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{Question 16}

Define $\operatorname{Lip}[0,1] = \{ f \in C[0,1] : f \text{ is Lipschitz } \}$. For each $n \geq 1$, define $F_n = \{ f \in C[0,1] : |f(x) - f(y)| \leq n | x - y| \text{ for all } x, y \in [0,1] \}$.

16.1

Prove that for each $n \geq 1$, $F_n$ is a closed, nowhere dense subset of $\operatorname{Lip}[0,1]$.

16.2

Conclude that  $\operatorname{Lip}[0,1]$ is a countable union of nowhere dense subsets of $C[0,1]$.

\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Solution]

Obviously, $F_n \subset \operatorname{Lip}[0,1]$, as we may just take $n$ to be a Lipschitz constant.

Consider $U_n = (F_n)^c$, the compliment of $F_n$. We wish to show that this set is open.

Let $f \in U_n$. Evidently then, there exists $x, y \in [0,1]$ such that $| f(x) - f(y) | > n | x - y| $. Fix a choice $x_0,y_0$ (where, evidently, $x_0 \not = y_0$ as the inequality always holds then), without loss of generality, we may assume $f(x_0) > f(y_0)$ and otherwise swap labels, and call $d = f(x_0) - f(y_0) - n | x_0 - y_0|$.

Now, let $g$ be in the open ball around $f$ with radius at most $d/2$. From the condition of being in the ball of radius at most $d/2$, we must have that $g(y_0) > g(x_0)$, since $d < | f(x_0) - f(y_0)|$, and hence, from the supremum norm, $g(y_0) \geq f(y_0) - d/2  > [f(x_0) + f(y_0)]/2$ and similarly, $g(x_0) \leq f(x_0) + d/2 < [f(x_0) + f(y_0)]/2$. Thus, we have that at $x_0, y_0$ for $g$, that:

$$ g(y_0) - g(x_0) \geq f(y_0) - d/2  - f(x_0) - d/2  = f(y_0) - f(x_0) - d = n |x_0 - y_0| $$

Since we can arbitrarily shrink the ball to have radius smaller than $d/2$, say $d/3$, this shows that we may find an open ball around any $f \in U_n$, hence $U_n$ is open, and thus $F_n$ is closed.

Now, we need to show that $F_n$ is nowhere dense. Let $f \in F_n$. Let $\epsilon > 0$, and suppose without loss of generality that $f(0) \geq f(\epsilon/n+1)$. Consider the continuous function $g_\epsilon$ such that it takes on $\epsilon$ at 0, joined linearly to $0$ at $\epsilon/n+1$, and constantly $0$ otherwise. Of course, this is continuous, with $\Vert g_\epsilon \Vert_u = \epsilon$. Furthermore, we can consider the function $f + g_\epsilon$, and in particular, compute $f + g_\epsilon(0) - [f + g_\epsilon(\epsilon/n+1)]$. We have that:

$$ f + g_\epsilon(0) - [ f+ g_\epsilon(\epsilon/n+1)] = f(0) - f(\epsilon/n+1) + g_n(0) - g_n(\epsilon/n+1) \geq g_n(0) - g_n(\epsilon/n+1) = \epsilon > \epsilon/n+1$$

where we use the fact that $f(0) \geq f(\epsilon/n+1)$ for one inequality, and the fact that $n \geq 1$ for the other. Hence, $f + g_n$ is not Lipschitz. If $f(0) < f(\epsilon/n+1)$, the same argument holds by taking $-g_\epsilon$.

Since the choice of $f$ was arbitrary, this implies that $F_n$ contains no non-trivial open subsets, and thus, as it is its own closure, $F_n$ is nowhere dense.

Clearly, $\operatorname{Lip}[0,1] = \cup F_n$. We have that $F_n \subseteq \operatorname{Lip}[0,1]$ for each $n$, since we may take $n$ as a Lipschitz constant. Hence, $\cup F_n \subseteq \operatorname{Lip}[0,1]$.

On the other hand, let $g \in \operatorname{Lip}[0,1]$. Then, there exists a constant $K \geq 0$ such that $| g(x) - g(y) | \leq K | x - y | $ for all $x, y \in [0,1]$. Then, since this inequality clearly holds for $K' \geq K$, taking any integer $k \geq K$, we see that $g \in F_k$. Hence, $\operatorname{Lip}[0,1] \subseteq \cup F_n$, and we are done.

\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{Question 17}

Let $f$ be a nonnegative Lebesgue measurable function defined on $\mathbb{R}$. Assume that for all $g \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$, $fg \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$. Prove that $T_f(g) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} gf$ is a bounded linear functional on $L^2$, and conclude that $f \in L^2$.

\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Solution]

First, we use the $\sigma$-finiteness of $\mathbb{R}$, and consider the compact sets $E_i = [ -i, i ]$. Additionally, for each $E_i$, we define $f_n$ in the following fashion:

$$ f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & x \not \in E_n \\ \min(f(x), n) & x \in E_n \end{cases}$$

Certainly, if $f$ is measurable, so too are each $f_n$, as if we look at, for $a > 0$, $\{ f_n > a \}$, if $ a \geq n$, then this is exactly $\{ f \geq n \}$, if $ a < n$, then it aligns exactly with $ \{ f > a \}$. And lastly, if $a \leq 0$, then the preimage is the entire codomain, hence still measurable.

Moreover, each $f_n$ is clearly in $L^2$, as it has compact support, contained within $E_n$, and is bounded above by $n$. Hence, we can say that:

$$ \Vert f_n \Vert_2^2 = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f_n = \int_{E_n} f_n \leq \int_{E_n} n = 2n^2 < \infty $$

Now, consider the family of linear functionals determined as:

\begin{align*}
T_n: & L^2(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R} \\
T_n: & g \mapsto \int f_n g
\end{align*}

where this is clearly linear in terms of $g$, due to the linearity of the integral and distributivity of mutliplication.

%Since $f_n \leq f$ everywhere, we have that $|f_n g | \leq |fg|$ everywhere. Hence, we have that $\int f_n g \leq \int fg < \infty$, due to $fg \in L^1$, and so $f_n g \in L^1$.

By H\"older's inequality then, since $f_n, g \in L^2$, we have that:

$$ \Vert f_n g \Vert_1 \leq \Vert f_n \Vert_2 \Vert g \Vert_2$$

However, we've already computed $\Vert f_n \Vert_2 \leq 2n^2$. Hence, we have that:

$$ | T_n(g) | = \left| \int f_n g \right| \leq \int |f_n g | = \Vert f_n g \Vert_1 \leq \Vert f_n \Vert_2 \Vert g \Vert_2 \leq 2n^2 \Vert g \Vert_2 $$

Hence, for each $n$, $T_n$ is a bounded linear functional, with norm at most $2n^2$.

Now, fix any $g \in L^2$, and consider $| T_n(g)|$ again. For every $n$, we have that due to the fact that $f_n \leq f$ everywhere:

$$ | T_n(g) | = \left| \int f_n g \right | \leq \int | f_n g |  \leq \int |f||g| = \Vert fg \Vert_1 < \infty $$

Since this is true for all $n$, we may conclude that for all $g \in L^2$, that $\sup_{n} | T_n(g) | < \infty$. Since $L^2$ is a Banach space, we may now apply the Uniform Boundedness Principle and conclude that

$$ \sup_{n} \Vert T_n \Vert < \infty$$

Thus, we need only show that $ \Vert T_f \Vert = \sup_{n} \Vert T_n \Vert$. Of course, $f_ng \to fg$ almost everywhere, by the definition of $f_n$, and further, $fg$ itself is integrable and then so is $|fg|$, and $| f_n g | \leq |fg|$ by the definition of $f_n$. Hence, we may use an application of the Dominated Convergence Theorem, as well as picking an arbitrary $g \in L^2$ with $\Vert g \Vert = 1$, to see that:

%$$\lim_{n \to \infty} T_n(g) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int |f_n g| = \int |fg| = T_f(g)$$

%Since this is true for all $g \in L^2$, we may restrict ourselves to where $\Vert g \Vert_2  = 1$, and so we have that:

$$ | T_f(g) | = \left| \int fg \right| = \left|  \lim_{n \to \infty} \int f_n g \right| = \left| \lim_{n \to \infty} T_n(g) \right| = \lim_{n \to \infty} | T_n(g)| \leq \lim_{n \to \infty} \Vert T_n \Vert \leq \sup_{n} \Vert T_n \Vert$$

Since this is true for all $g \in L^2$ with unit norm, we may conclude then that $\Vert T_f \Vert \leq \sup_{n} \Vert T_n \Vert$. However, earlier, we already showed that $|T_n(g)| \leq |T_f(g)|$ due to the fact that $f_n \leq f$ everywhere. Hence, we have that $\Vert T_f \Vert = \sup_{n} \Vert T_n \Vert < \infty$, and hence $T_f$ is a bounded linear functional. 

Now, by the Riesz Representation Theorem, since $L^2$ is a Hilbert space, this implies that we may find an $h \in L^2$ such that $T_n(g) = \langle g, h \rangle$. In particular then, we have that:

$$ T_n(g) = \int fg = \langle g, h \rangle = \int gh \implies \int fg - \int gh = 0 \implies \int g(f-h) = 0 \implies f = h \; a.e.$$

Where because this works for all $g \in L^2$, we are free to pick $g$ to be non-negative, and $f = h$ follows because this single function $h$ must work regardless of the choice of $g$. Hence, $f$ may be identified as a member of an equivalence class in $L^2$.
\end{proof}


\begin{problem}{Question 19}

Suppose $\mathcal{B}$ is a Banach space, and let $S$ be a closed proper subspace. Fix some $f_0 \not \in S$. Show that there exists a continuous linear functional $\gamma$ such that $\gamma(f) = 0$ for all $f \in S$, and $\gamma(f_0) = 1$. Moreover, show that we may choose the linear functional such that $\Vert \gamma \Vert = 1/d$, where $d$ is the distance from $f_0$ to $S$.

\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Solution]

First, we notice that $d$, the distance between $f_0, S$ must be positive as otherwise, we could find a descending series of $s_n$ such that $\Vert f_0 - s_n \Vert \to 0$. In such a case, $S$ being closed would imply that $f_0 \in S$, a contradiction.

Now, consider the vector subspace $T = \operatorname{span}\{ S, f_0 \}$. We claim that for every $t \in T$, there exists a unique representation $t = s_{t} + a_{t} f_0$,  for $s_{t} \in S$ and $a_{t}$ a scalar.

Suppose we had that $s_{t} + a_{t} f_0 = t = s'_t + a'_t f_0$. Then, we must have that $(s_t - s'_t) + (a_t - a'_t) f_0 = 0$. Since $f_0 \not \in S$, we must have that $(s_t - s'_t) = 0, (a_t - a'_t) f_0 = 0$. Hence, we must have that $s_t = s'_t$, and that $a_t - a'_t = 0 \implies a_t = a'_t$.

Now, define a functional $\lambda: T \to F$ that sends $t \mapsto a_t$, where $a_t$ comes from the representation above. Clearly, we see from the representation that this must be linear:

$$ \lambda( t + t') = \lambda(s_t + a_t f_0 + s_{t'} + a_{t'} f_0) = \lambda((s_t + s_{t'}) + (a_t + a_{t'}) f_0) = a_t + a_{t'} = \lambda(t) + \lambda(t')$$

where we've used the fact that $S$ is a subspace to conclude $s_t + s_{t'} \in S$, and:

$$ \lambda(bt) = \lambda(b(s_t + a_t f_0)) =\lambda(bs_t + ba_t f_0) = b a_t = b\lambda(t)$$

and we omit $\lambda(0)  = 0 $, as of course, $ 0 = 0 + 0f_0$. 

Also, certainly, $\lambda |_{S} = 0$, since for any $s \in S$, we have the representation in $T$, $s = s + 0 f_0$, and of course then, $\lambda(s) = 0$. Finally, in a similar fashion, we have that $f_0 = 0 + f_0$, and hence $\lambda(f_0) = 1$.

Thus, we need only show that $\lambda$ is bounded, with norm $\frac{1}{d}$.

Let $t$ be an arbitrary non-0 vector in $T$, with non-0 component of $f_0$, as of course, if that were true, $\lambda(t) = 0$. We notice that, since $t = s_t + a_t f_0 = a_t( a_t^{-1} s_t + f_0)$, that:

$$ \Vert t \Vert = \Vert a_t( a_t^{-1} s_t + f_0) \Vert = | a_t | \Vert (a_t^{-1} s_t + f_0 \Vert$$

and since $a_t^{-1} s_t \in S$ due to being a scalar multiple, we must have that $\Vert a_t^{-1} s_t + f_0 \Vert \geq d$, as $d$ is the infimum of $\Vert f_0 - s \Vert$, and we can always replace $s$ with $-s_t$, as necessary. Hence, using the fact that $a_t = \lambda(t)$, we have that:

$$ \Vert t \Vert \geq |a_t| d = |\lambda(t) | d \implies |\lambda(t)| \leq \frac{1}{d} \Vert t \Vert $$

Since this is true for all $t$, including when $a_t = 0$ due to the observation earlier, we have that $\lambda$ is bounded, and $\Vert \lambda \Vert_{T^*} \leq \frac{1}{d}$ by definition.

Now, again, since $d$ is the infimum of $\Vert f_0 - s \Vert$ for $s \in S$, we may find $\{ s_n \} \subset S$ such that $\Vert f_0 - s_n \Vert \to d$. Then, considering the action of lambda on each of these, we have that:

$$ 1 = | \lambda(f_0) | = | \lambda(f_0 - s_n) |   \leq \Vert \lambda \Vert_{T^*} \Vert f_0 - s_n \Vert_T  $$

Taking the limit as $n \to \infty$ then, we retrieve the inequality

$$ 1 \leq \Vert \lambda \Vert_{T^*} d \implies \Vert \lambda \Vert_{T^*} \geq \frac{1}{d}$$

Hence, $\Vert \lambda \Vert_{T^*} = \frac{1}{d}$.

Now, by Corollary 2.2 in Heil, since $\mathcal{B}$ is a Banach space, $T$ a subspace of $\mathcal{B}$, $\lambda \in T^*$, there exists a $\gamma \in \mathcal{B}^*$ such that $\gamma(f_0) = \lambda(f_0) = 1$, $\gamma(s) = \lambda(s) = 0$ for all $s \in S$, and $\Vert \gamma \Vert_{\mathcal{B}^*} = \Vert \lambda \Vert_{T^*} = \frac{1}{d}$ as desired.
\end{proof}
